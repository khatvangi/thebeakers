  "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to rewrite a research article for The Beakers, making it exciting and connected to undergraduate STEM courses. They need specific sections like the headline, hook, researchers, problem, approach, key findings, etc. \n\nFirst, the headline needs to be catchy but accurate. Maybe something like \"Engineered Peptides Revolutionize CAR-T Therapy for Solid Tumors\" \u2013 that's 10-15 words, and it ties into the research's focus.\n\nThe hook should make students care. Maybe connect it to their future careers, like how this research could impact cancer treatment, which is a big deal.\n\nFor the researchers section, I need to list the authors and describe their expertise. Since the paper is in ACS, they're likely chemists or biochemists. Mention their roles in peptide design and CAR-T engineering.\n\nThe problem section should explain the current limitations in CAR-T for solid tumors. Maybe previous methods have issues with stability or targeting. Highlight why this is a big issue for patients.\n\nApproach: They used DDMPs with disulfide bonds. I need to explain this in plain language. Maybe compare disulfide bonds to molecular Velcro. Mention techniques like solid-phase peptide synthesis and NMR for structure analysis.\n\nKey findings should include specifics like improved stability, higher efficacy, and maybe some surprising results. Also, note any limitations they mentioned.\n\nWhy it matters: Impact on cancer treatment, potential for safer therapies, and how this could change clinical practices.\n\nCurriculum connections are crucial. Need to link to at least three courses. For example, Biochemistry's protein structure, Organic Chemistry's reaction mechanisms, and Physical Chemistry's thermodynamics. Use specific concepts like alpha helices, electrophilic addition, and Gibbs free energy. Make sure to include \"remember when\" statements to connect to classroom learning.\n\nKey terms should define terms like disulfide bonds, multicyclic peptides, etc., with analogies.\n\nDifficulty level: Sophomore, since it requires intro-level courses like organic and biochem.\n\nConcept map needs a Mermaid.js flowchart. Use linear layout for problem \u2192 method \u2192 results. Nodes should be short and connected properly.\n\nAudio teaser: Three engaging sentences that make listeners curious.\n\nThink about: A question that connects the research to everyday life or future careers, like how this could affect personalized medicine.\n\nNapkin visual: Choose a layout that fits the data structure. Since the research involves combining factors, a convergence layout makes sense. Title could be \"Multi-Factor Synthesis\", with factors like Peptide chemistry, Bond engineering, Antigen design, and outcome as Effective therapy.\n\nNeed to ensure all sections are accurate, accessible, and thoroughly connected to classroom concepts. Avoid jargon, use analogies, and make each section flow naturally. Check for the required word counts and formatting, especially the curriculum connections which are the most important part. Make sure to end with the paragraph about how concepts are foundational to real-world problems.\n</think>\n\n## HEADLINE  \nEngineered Peptides Revolutionize CAR-T Therapy for Solid Tumors  \n\n## HOOK  \nWhy should an undergrad care about this?
